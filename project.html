        <h3>Today – Setting up to do list</h3>
        <img src="images/today1.png" alt="set up">
        <p>This interface enables users to set up several individual tasks and from a to-do list. Users can customize task content, time and icon. According to different settings, the system will provide various reminders when a task starts, ends or in progress. When users have their own to do list, they can activate the competition function</p>
        <h3>Today – Competition</h3>
        <img src="images/today2.png" alt="competition">
        <p>The system will match two users to compete with each other based on their similarity of task content and time distribution. Whoever has higher completion rate wins, but if both competitors have the same completion rate, the one that spends shorter time wins. By winning the competition users can get additional rewards.</p>
        <h3>Calendar</h3>
        <img src="images/calendar.png" alt="calendar">
        <p>The main function of calendar is to record and remind. The task set up by the user in “today” will be automatically added to the calendar. Selecting different time ranges, the layout of the calendar will also be changed accordingly.  It is worth mentioning that, the application’s calendar support to import google calendar and iOS built-in calendar information, and allows natural language input.</p>
        <h3>Report</h3>
        <img src="images/report.png" alt="report">
        <p>In the report module, users will learn about their time management status through pie charts and corresponding statistics. The top menu is suitable for selecting different time ranges to present the corresponding data for that period. Users will also have the freedom of pulling data from the pie chart and sharing this report on social media.</p>
        <h3>Kingdom</h3>
        <img src="images/kingdom.png" alt="game">
        <p>Here users can build their dream kingdom. In addition to the gold coins and diamonds acquired through finishing to-do list and winning competition, there are occasional exciting events in the Kingdom, and small rewards are offered if users accomplish the goal of these events. Users will gain wealth through their efforts and use it to open up new territory and thrive the Kingdom.</p>

        <h2>Design Process</h2>
        <h3>Problem statement</h3>
        <p>Like many college students, I am having trouble with time management. Massive course load, school activities, party with friends, and there’s a part-time job, I find it hard to balance them all. And when I look around,  I find out that I am not alone, similar problems plagued almost all of the students. Everyone is trying to make some changes: looking for peer support, making personal plans, and downloading apps that improve time management, etc.. However, these don’t seem to be very helpful, as everyone is still frustrated when facing various deadlines.</p>
        <img src="images/time.png" alt="time">
        <h3>Research</h3>
        <p>I first did some research online and found that many agencies have conducted research on student’s time management issues. Among them, an article published by Cengage caught my attention. They did a survey and found out that over 80% college student is having trouble in time management, and the top barriers to effective time management are procrastination, distraction, and poor planning.</p>
        <img src="images/chart.jpg" alt="chart">
        <p>Then I interviewed six students and wished to get answers to two questions from their responses: What do they think led to their time management issues? Why did the solutions they have tried fail?</p>
        <img src="images/interview.png" alt="interview">
        <p>According to the interview, I learned that user needs and pain points are focused on affordance, organization structure, information, incentive, etc.. I selected four of the most popular solution for poor time management that my target users have tried, and use user’s top 6 concerns as a standard to conduct a competitive analysis.</p>
        <img src="images/spider.png" alt="spider">
        <p>I got some insight through research</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Users need more than just planning; they need more useful information to help them understand their time management goals and status.</li>
            <li>One of the reasons that lead to user’s procrastination is the lack of positive pressure and reasonable incentives.</li>     
            <li>Making time management a little bit more joyful will motivate users to get their job done.</li>       
        </ul>
        <h3>Persona</h3>
        <p>Through research, I deepened my understanding of the characteristics and needs of users and developed three target users’ persona and one anti persona. Later when I was working on specific features, I frequently referred to primary and secondary personas, which ensured me always to bear the needs of users in mind and not to overweight my preferences to user’s real idea. At the same time, I also checked my anti persona when there was a new idea, which helped me to distinguish what functions did not serve my target audience, then I need to delete these useless features.</p>
        <img src="images/persona.jpg" alt="persona">
        <h3>Brainstorming</h3>
        <p>With target user and directions for improvement been identified, I sketched some alternatives that matched user’s needs and expectation, and further portrayed possible user scenarios for these solutions.</p>
        <img src="images/sketch1.jpg" alt="sketch1">
        <img src="images/sketch2.jpg" alt="sketch2">
        <p>After sketching, I confirmed that I eventually wanted to design a mobile application to help solve student’s time management issue. This application needs to meet the following goals:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Let users be aware of different deadlines.</li>
            <li>Encourage users to break down complex tasks, and complete these tasks step by step.</li>
            <li>Allow users to understand their own time management goals and status conveniently.            </li>
            <li>Use stress and incentive reasonably to encourage users to act now.</li>
            <li>Make user experience both friendly and fun.</li>
        </ul>    
        <h3>System map</h3>
        <p>Based on these goals, I identified the main functions of the TIMO and plotted the structure of this app.</p>
        <img src="images/map.png" alt="system map">
        <h3>QOC</h3>
        <p>Here I got a chance to think about the feature I wanted to have in my design and reasons behind my choice. When I drew the QOC chart, I started to link individual elements and reconsider my former option based on both positive and negative criteria. During this process, I settled down some critical features for the competition function.</p>
        <img src="images/qoc.jpg" alt="QOC">
        <img src="images/wireframe.png" alt="wireframe">
        <h3>Paper Prototype & User Testing</h3>
        <p>At this stage, I have confirmed the function of TIMO and the corresponding manifestations, so I made the paper prototype and conducted a basic user test.  The goal of the test is to successfully have the user navigate within the app to different modules, create a new task in their to-do lists, get the notification and finish the task, participate a competition, to check the report, and construct their own kingdom.</p>

    <div class="reflection">
        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Participatory design:  Since my target audience is my classmates and friends, it’s easy to get them involved in my design process. I showed them my sketches and asked them to test my prototypes. During the group discussion section, I actively discussed with them about my new ideas or asked them what they wish to have. Through these activities, I have harvested a lot of useful suggestions and ideas, which I can not get by working alone.</li>
            <li>Crucial facts: First, the pressure of competition can also play an active role as long as it is benign and well-controlled. Second, people are more motivated when they are rewarded for completing their task than being punished for not completing a job.</li>
        </ul>
